# Smart-Conveyor
This project simulates a smart conveyor system using an ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. The  system measures conveyor speed using timer capture, controls motor speed via a  potentiometer, detects passing objects, and displays all relevant information on an LCD. It also  includes an emergency stop feature triggered by an interrupt.
